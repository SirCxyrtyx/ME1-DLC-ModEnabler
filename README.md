# ME1-DLC-ModEnabler
Makes ME1 recognize Mods-As-DLCs

Will automatically do all the bookkeeping neccesary for ME1 mods to function as a DLC package, every time the game starts up. Without this installed, files in DLCs will not override files from the base game. Works invisibly and doesn't add any noticeable amount of time to startup (takes 0.16 seconds on my computer).

**Installation:**

Requires [ErikJS's binkw32 dlls](https://github.com/Erik-JS/masseffect-binkw32/releases/download/r4/me1_binkw32.zip) for ME1

Put those in your `Mass Effect\Binaries` folder, then create a folder there called ASI, and put [this](https://github.com/SirCxyrtyx/ME1-DLC-ModEnabler/releases/download/v1.0/ME1-DLC-ModEnabler-v1.asi) in it.
